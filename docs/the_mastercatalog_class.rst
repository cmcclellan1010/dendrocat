The MasterCatalog Class
=====================

A `~dendrocat.MasterCatalog` object combines multiple `~dendrocat.RadioSource` objects, retaining each object's attributes while creating a new, combined catalog from the sources contained in their individual catalogs.

The `~dendrocat.MasterCatalog` enables analysis not possible with a single `~dendrocat.RadioSource` object, such as photometry and catalog cross-matching.
